FE Lab
=================
This repositiory is to be used as starter kit for FE projects, so coding standards, workflow, and codebase is as normalized as possible.

Global Dev Requirements
-------------
  * npm (http://nodejs.org/)
  * gulp
  * styledown
  * uglifyjs
  * stylint
  * nodemon

Cloning FELab
-------------
- If you are about to start a new project, then clone FELab as starter. Afterwards, for the clone, change the origin url in git to point to the url of the new project repository. (Remove this clone notice for the new project.)

```
git clone https://$username@bitbucket.org/loweproferotech/fe-lab.git
mv fe-lab $new-project-name # rename the directory
cd $new-project-name
git remote set-url origin https://$username@bitbucket.org/loweproferotech/$name.git
```

- Create a new dev branch and start your work from there. Be sure to follow the README.md guides found in the various source directories.

Install
-------------
First install all global requirements if not already on system

```
npm install -g gulp styledown uglifyjs stylint nodemon
cd $new-project-name
npm install
```

Run
-------------

```
cd $new-project-name

gulp # defaults with port 5000
```

Options
-------------
There are some options that can be enabled when running `gulp`:  
- `-lr`   # to enable live reloading with browser-sync  
- `-img`  # enable `gulp-imagemin`; The source images will then be loaded from the directory `src\img`. So make sure you have created that directory if you enable this option.  
- `-maps` # enable sourcemaps  
- `-wall` # watch all altered files, including deleted and new; slower than standard `gulp.watch`  
- `-port=#` # change the server port #; default is 5000    
- `-deploy` # app js will not be minified by default, add this option for production/live env  
- `-js`   # Use this option if you prefer coding with classic JS (src/js) instead of CoffeeScript, default is CoffeeScript (src/coffee)

Examples
```
gulp -maps
gulp -lr -img
gulp coffee -deploy
```

Deploy
-------------
You can deploy this to http://loweproferotech.bitbucket.org/bb-felab/ by running:
```
npm run deploy
```
You must set up deploy.sh from the https://bitbucket.org/loweproferotech/loweproferotech.bitbucket.org repo.  
Change vars in deploy.sh to:
```
projectName=bb-felab
repo=https://{username}@bitbucket.org/loweproferotech/loweproferotech.bitbucket.org.git
## set username OR use git@bitbucket.org:loweproferotech/loweproferotech.bitbucket.org.git as repo url
```

HTTPS
-------------
SSL is available. Start the project on PORT 80 with:
```
npm start # enter your password and browse https://localhost
```

Styleguide
-------------
Stylus files need to be documented so that the style guide can be automatically generated. We use a very simple generator which does all the heavy lifting called [Styledown](https://github.com/styledown/styledown). 
```
npm run style # generates updated style guide
```

Git Standards
--------------
- Please use proper commit message being consistent with either the present or past tense.  
-- A proper commit message must have a noun and a verb. A commit like "update" is not good. Instead "Update _carousel.styl header"  
-- Fixed issues should have issue # in commit message  
- Do NOT merge anything to `master`  
  
Coding Standards
--------------
- 2 spaces as a tab for JS, CSS, CoffeeScript, Stylus, Jade  
- camelCase JS variable/function names  
- Utilize the DRY principle in your code; do not repeat the same code in multiple areas; use stylus & jade mixins, JS functions etc to key code dry
- CSS class/id names with dashed format: eg. .c-carousel, .icon-logo, #unique-element
- If the project must be ADA compliant, make sure that you set up landmarks from the very start
- Do NOT use browserify and shim in the project. See vendor/README.md for details.
- !!IMPORTANT!! Markup should be built in modules and CSS classes should reflect the start of a module. Consider the following markup, notice that every area where a new module is, it is very distinct. Modules are clearly prefixed with `.c-`. 
- Stylus files need to be documented so that the style guide can be automatically generated.
```
<body>
  <div class="c-header">
    <div class="c-hero">...</div>
    <div class="c-nav" role="navigation" aria-label="Main navigation">
      <ul class="c-horizontal-list"></ul>
    </div>
  <div>
  <div class="c-main" role="main">
  <section class="c-article">
    <section class="c-breadcrumbs">
      <span class="l-inline-block ic-bread">
      <span class="l-inline-block meta">Home > Rules</span>
    </section>
    <section class="c-article-main">...</section>
    <section class="c-article-footer">...</section>
  </section>
  </div>
  <div class="c-footer">
    <section class="c-footer-nav" role="navigation" aria-label="Footer Navigation"></section>
    <section class="c-copyright" role="contentinfo">....</section>
  </div>
</body>
```

Linters
------------
- Stylint: To enforce the best practices in CSS and stylus, stylint is used. See the rules in bin/config.stylintrc file. Find out what these options mean at [stylint github](https://github.com/rossPatton/stylint):
